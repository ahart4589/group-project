    description_p1: "GeoNet Health Service was developed from the What3words geocoding platform. This global addressing system  provides a gridded map layer using a fine geographic resolution of 3x3 meters squares. Leveraging the power in this platform we can connect people to places in a way that has never before been possible. With a pinpointed location emergency services can be provided and goods can be delivered specifically where they are needed.",
    description_p2: 'This global response system was designed to meet the needs of pregnant mothers in hard to reach communities who planned to coordinate a taxi to take them to a hospital to deliver. Expectant women are able to use a short message service to alert their community health worker or regional health center when they need transport or other complications arises. With a registered address a taxi with a GPS can locate the woman in need and deliver her to care.',
    description_p3: 'The application is focused on Sierra Leone because the country has a critically high maternal mortality ratio where approximately 1 in 17 mothers are at risk of death associated with child birth. In this country connecting women to care and information is critical. In order to make progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals of 2030 Sierra Leone must continue to reduce the maternal mortality ratio. This will require training more health workers to reach rural communities and bringing medical supplies and services within reach for these women. GeoNet Health Services can expand the reach of a single health worker by connecting them with patients and optimizing the delivery of services. Additionally, women can obtain transportation to a clinic and subscribe to a text based reminder system to improve their prenatal and antenatal health.',
    description_p4: "GeoNet Health Service will continue to develop and adapt to support the needs of the communities, and together with the dedicated health workers of the Sierra Leone, continue to improve the outcomes of mothers and their children.",
    mission : "We believe that an address serves a critical societal need. A standardized location serves individuals and communities by connecting them to the outside world when an emergency arises or disaster strikes. GeoNet Health Services will bring medical supplies and emergency response to those in need in locations that have historically been inaccessible.",
    howItWorks: "GeoNet Health Service is an sms based emergency response system. Users message a virtual number hosted on Twilio that connects to a Node.js server. This server sends and receives messages and based on the sms content it receives it can initiate an emergecncy alert to the nearest health worker in the event of an emergency. During the registration users provide a What3words address that is geocoded to a latitude and longitude. Users complete a background survey during the registration process which is stored in a database. The information from the database is used to display the applications front end where all registered patients are tracked and emergency alerts are displayed in real time."
